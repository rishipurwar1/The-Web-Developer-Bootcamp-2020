Question-1
Answer is t because "t" is the 8th letter in the word, but it has an index of 7 (JS starts counting at 0)

Question-2
Answer is 2 because JavaScript doesn't add any spaces automatically, it just join two strings together!

Question-3
Answer is "19981" because When adding a string and a number, JS behaves oddly! It turns the number into a string and smushes them together. This is called type coersion. Type coersion happens behind the scenes.
